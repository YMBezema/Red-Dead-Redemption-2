;FallTimeDeath is the time in milliseconds an NPC has to be falling to be dead afterwards
FallTimeDeath = 100000

;HorseFallingDelta is a value to be specified in milliseconds - NPCs on mounts will collapse when shot and the game counts them as falling as soon as they are not sitting properly in the saddle
;thus most of them will die from FallTimeDeath since they will be stuck on the horse until gravity pulls them down -> this value is the delta for the falling time to start calculating
;if the value is 6000, then 6000 milliseconds after a mounted NPC leaves its mount, the falling counter will start counting (if the NPC is falling) - so mounted NPCs are safe from a death by falling for this amount of time

;UseAnimChance is the chance of writhing animations being used instead of NPCs just lying there in pain (the percentage reflects the percentage in NPCs - so 50 will make every second NPC use animations)

;OnlyBleedOnTorsoShot can be set to either 0 or 1 - if set to 1, NPCs will only bleed (= bleeding effects below) if they are shot in the torso
;(this comes in handy if you want to catch a wanted NPC alive -> legs can be shot without having to fear the bleedout -> you can also use HogtieBleedingStop if you want)

OnlyBleedOnTorsoShot = 1

;BodyDamageInterval can be configured in milliseconds
;since NPCs can also damage their body parts when falling, the mod remembers the last time an NPC was shot by the player - if an NPC was shot by the player and a body part is being damaged within BodyDamageInterval,
;the NPCs body part counts as being shot (thus e.g. enabling the NPC to bleed - for OnlyBleedOnTorsoShot, for example), if the body part is damaged after the BodyDamageInterval has passed, the body part won't be marked as "damaged"

;DamagedLegsDownTime is the amount of time in milliseconds after which an NPC gets forced to the ground after both its legs got shot at least once (each)
;example: a value of 10000 means that 10 seconds after an NPC was shot in both legs, it will be forced to the ground and into Dying States
DamagedLegsDownTime = 1500

;LegsHitThreshold is the amount of times an NPC has to be hit in each leg before going down (overrides DamagedLegsDownTime)
;example: a value of 3 means that each leg has to be hit 3 times, then the NPC will go into Dying States
LegsHitThreshold = 2

;BleedingSave is the time in milliseconds an NPC is saved from bleeding out after getting downed by leg shots - this is to prevent immersion-breaking deaths (falling down from leg shots and dying almost instantly)
;example: if the value is 10000, this means that if an NPC is forced to the ground by LegsHitThreshold or DamagedLegsDownTime, it will start to bleed out 10 seconds after going down
BleedingSave = 10000

;ZValueForHeadBone is used for checking the z-value of the vector returned by | ENTITY::GET_WORLD_POSITION_OF_ENTITY_BONE(peds[i], 21030) | -> peds[i] is the current NPC and 21030 is the bone ID of its head
;if the z-value of the head is above this value, the dyingpush does not trigger
ZValueForHeadBone2 = 3000

;ZValueForHipBone is used for checking the z-value of the vector returned by | ENTITY::GET_WORLD_POSITION_OF_ENTITY_BONE(peds[i], 14415) | -> peds[i] is the current NPC and 14415 is the bone ID of its lower spine
;if the z-value of the hip is above this value, the dying movement does not trigger
ZValueForHipBone = 500

;RagdollingSpeedThreshold is the speed an NPC is allowed to have for the ragdolling to set in (DyingStates) - if the NPC is moving with a speed above the threshold, ragdolling will not happen (since it can look weird)

;DyingMovementAudioChance is the chance per script iteration (~millisecond) that pain audio is played in stage 1 of DyingMovement, the audio 01, 02 and 03 are the sounds which are played (decided by chance)

;PanicChance is the chance of NPCs audibly panicking when taking damage from the player
PanicChance = 2

;PanicChanceHelpless is the chance of NPCs audibly panicking when taking damage from the player or being threatened by the player (like pointing a gun) while not being able to defend themselves (e.g. being in ragdoll)
PanicChanceHelpless = 5

;FemalePushModifier is the value the normal push value is divided by when pushing is applied to female NPCs (because they are lighter than male NPCs)
FemalePushModifier = 3

;HandsUpTime is the time in milliseconds for NPCs to at least put their hands up if a mod-feature (like disarming) forces them to
HandsUpTime = 400000

;HandsUpDelta is the time in milliseconds the mod waits after an NPC is disarmed and the DisarmHandsUpChance is triggered, before it tasks the NPC with the "hands up" behavior
HandsUpDelta = 500
HandsUpDeltaMounted = 500

;HandsUpRadius is the radius around the player in which NPCs put their hands up when being disarm and DisarmHandsUpChance is triggered (the value is divided by 100 before it is used for measurement)

;ShowNPCHealth shows the following information about the NPC last aimed at:
;NPCHealth - current NPC health
;Torso hit - if the NPC was hit in the torso
;Damaged by weapon - if the NPC was hit by a weapon
;Legs hit - if this value is any other than 0, the NPC has been forced to the ground because its legs were damaged
;DS enabled - if the Dying States apply to this NPC or not (if this is 1, then the NPC will be forced into dying states when its health is under the thresholds)
