Configure script mods:

# Key changes
Combat is chaotic and punishing. Getting hit can injure you and knock you back, but the same goes for your enemies. Well placed shots cripple or outright kill enemies. 

It's harder to die, but getting roughed up racks up nasty injuries. Stock medicine to deal with them. Dying means you lose a large amount of money.

The game economy is harsh, and forces you into the outlaw lifestyle. Rewards are scaled back, stocking up on items regularly is important, jewelry is rare but more valuable.

# Script Mods (.asi plugins)

**_Bandit_Hideouts.asi**, configurable
Randomly turns points of interests into bandit hideouts. Get a cash reward for clearing them. 

**Banking.asi**, configurable
Store your money at banks to protect yourself from losing it when dying. (You lose 25% of your money upon death)

**CombatExperience.asi**
Camera shake on getting hit, and melee weapons can dismember.

**CoresRegenOverTime1.0.asi**
Items that restore cores do so over a short amount of time instead of instantly.

**CriticalHits.asi**, configurable
Chance for player to get blown back when shot, depending on where you got hit.

**DSX.asi**
Dualsense controller features using the program DSX.

**DeadEyeActivationCooldownReloaded.asi**
Adds a cooldown timer to Dead Eye.

**DumpThatCargo1.1.asi**
While on horseback and moving slowly, press Reload to dump your horse cargo (so you don't need to dismount)

**FastWalk.asi**
Designed for controllers, increments player movement speed when tapping sprint, and decreases it when releasing the analogue stick. Alternative for keyboard: https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/2355

**Hard.asi**
Sleep only restores stamina core.

**HuntingCamp.asi**
While resting, use the "Set up camp" prompt to spawn a camp behind you. Buggy on uneven/obstructed terrain.

**Injury.asi**, configurable
Injury mechanic. Chance for one of your limbs to get injured when hit. Limbs can stack injuries when damaged repeatedly. Injuries are displayed on your HUD while any compass/minimap is showing.

Head injury: chance for Dead Eye to deactive prematurely depending on injury level.
Hand injury:  drain stamina while aiming two-handed/dual-wielded weapons. Doing so can increase your injury level.
Leg injury: slower injured movement animation, running rapidly drains stamina core and can further increase injury level.
Wounds (heart icon): bleeding damage over time. One level of wound can usually be ignored, multiple stacks of Wounds can quickly kill you.

Healing injuries: drink a tonic for the respective core to heal the injury over time, and to ignore the injury's effects while the tonic is active. Health tonics instantly cure Wounds, and boost the restoration rate of all injuries. Golden cores boost the restore rate even further. Sleep and baths also slowly restore injuries.

**Softer.asi**
Removes the auto reload when entering Dead Eye.

**StashThatLantern2.8.asi**

**TieYourLasso.asi**
Tie NPC's/objects to the ground. Kinda buggy/limited in functionality, might remove.

**NoHorseHolster.asi**
