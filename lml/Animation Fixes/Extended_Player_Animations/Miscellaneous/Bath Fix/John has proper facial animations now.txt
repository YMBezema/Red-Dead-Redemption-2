John now has proper facial animations when bathing, before, John would just have his default facial expression, making him seem a bit soulless.

I think the devs didn't want John to look like he's "enjoying" the deluxe baths, which I guess makes sense since he's married and all, but in my opinion, him staring at the abyss while bathing just looks too weird...
