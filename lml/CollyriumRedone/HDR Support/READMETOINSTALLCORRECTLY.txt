Install CollyriumRedone, then open the folder, and drag "Visuals" inside, it'll ask you if you want to replace one file, press yes and then you have HDR supported for Collyrium.
Remember to set HDR to "Game" in settings.
Have your HDR monitor properly callibrated.
Have your peak brightness somewhere close to 1600, can be a margin of 150 above or below if needed.
Set your paper white to around 140 to 165.
Depending on your monitor brightness or callibration, adjust above these margins as needed to get the best picture quality.
